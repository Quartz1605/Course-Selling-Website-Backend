## Introduction

This repository contains the backend API for a course selling platform (similar to Udemy) built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The platform supports both user and admin functionalities including course creation, purchasing, user authentication, and course management. As part of "Source Start," an open source event organized by CSI SPIT, we invite developers, backend enthusiasts, and API learners to contribute to this project by adding new features, improving security, enhancing database design, or optimizing the codebase.

## Main Project Objective
